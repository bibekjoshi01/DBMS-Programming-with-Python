The following example uses the SELECT statement to return full names and emails of all customers:

SELECT 
   first_name || ' ' || last_name,
   email
FROM 
   customer;


### PostgreSQL Column Alias

    * Assign a column or an expression a column alias using the syntax column_name AS alias_name or expression AS alias_name.
    * The AS keyword is optional.
    * Use double quotes (â€œ) to surround a column alias that contains spaces.

    SELECT
        first_name || ' ' || last_name as "full name"
    FROM
        customer;


### Order By

    * Use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement to sort rows.
    * Use the ASC option to sort rows in ascending order and DESC option to sort rows in descending order. The ORDER BY clause uses the ASC option by default.
    * Use NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST options to explicitly specify the order of NULL with other non-null values.

    select
        first_name, last_name, full_name, length(full_name) as full_name_len
    from
        base_app_user bau
    order by first_name asc, last_name asc nulls last ;
